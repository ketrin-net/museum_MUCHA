                <p class="text-6">Alphonse Mucha was a leading exponent of the Art-Nouveau style, <br>which demanded the creation of a decorative scheme that
                    would allow for the repetition of stylistic patterns. Mucha based his work on an image that lent itself to an
                    arrangement in cycles based on traditional themes, usually drawn from the physical world. For this reason, Mucha gave
                    his first set of decorative panels, made in 1896, the title The Four Seasons.

                    <p class="text-6">Posters made in Paris in the 1890s form the best-known and world famous segment of Mucha’s work. It was through them
                    that he managed to promote his own version of the new decorative style. The primary group consists of posters for Sarah
                    Bernhardt, who was a famous Parisian actress.

                    <p class="text-6">The two original proof prints for Gismonda are quite interesting. Mucha’s poster was too long for the common size of the
                    printer’s stone and so it was assumed that it had been printed on two stones. Proof print however proves that it was
                    printed using a single stone.

                <span class="text-4">SECTION 3. DOCUMENTS DÉCORATIFS</span>
                <p class="text-6">In 1902, Mucha published a collection of 72 plates with patterns, drawn in pencil and brightened with white paint, for
                stylistic work in arts and crafts, titled Documents Décoratifs. This portfolio includes various ornamental and
                naturalistic floral motifs, studies of women’s heads, and nudes, combining illusive naturalism with abstract ornamental
                framing. Jewellery, furniture, tableware and many other items related to domestic life at the time suggest that Mucha
                strove for a summary of his extensive experience in decoration, which, especially considering his work for the Paris
                World’s Fair of 1900 and the interior design for the Fouquet Jewellery Shop, left a two-dimensional plane expanding into
                three-dimensional space.

            <div class="info">
                <p class="text-6 main">After his permanent relocation back to his homeland in 1910, Alphonse Mucha returned to his long-held desire to
                systematically and single-mindedly, through his art, address his fellow people and express their needs and ideals.
                Gradually a new set of posters emerged, quite distinct in design from the Parisian ones.
                </p>
                <p class="text-6 additional">There were two prevalent themes: a new approach to folklore, emphasizing the colourful beauty of Moravian costumes and
                the gentle type of young Slav women (Moravian Teachers’ Choir, 1911), and the theme of the sports events and festivals
                of the Sokol organization, which had been a symbol of Czech national self-determination since the 19th century.

            <div class="info-2">
                <p class="text-6">In addition to these, there are also posters that strongly denounce the oppression of the Slavs (Lottery of the Union of
                Southwestern Moravia, 1912) and lyrical recollections of Parisian motifs (Princess Hyacinth, 1911). In these works,
                ornaments are subordinated to the melody of the line.
